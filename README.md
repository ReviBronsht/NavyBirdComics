### The Server (backend)

Initialization: Using the terminal, make sure to first cd into the backend directory. To start the server, use the following command: npm start. Contingent upon starting up the client (frontend) concurrently, the server will start serving requests from the client. The server is initialized either on the port defined as an environment variable PORT or 3001.

General Information: This server utilizes technology from the MERN stack, i.e. Mongo, Express and Node. React is used as the client (read more at the section "The Client"). The server connects to the DB using the Mongoose library, using mongodb atlas. Mongoose provides an easy way to include validation with MongoDB. 

Router Information: For more detailed information, please refer to the navyRouter.js file, under the Routes directory.

Mongoose Models: imageModel.js is utilized.
